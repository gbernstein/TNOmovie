# TNOmovie
Code and files to make DES TNO movie

the "dataa" folder contains the image and WCS files used in the movie. There is one image missing:
"213average.fz" because it is too big to upload to Git.
Here is a dropbox link to the file: https://www.dropbox.com/s/0o62ubedsczdjxb/213average.fz?dl=0

y4_tno_table.fits and orbits_culled_ast.fits are old tables from the y4 set (~300 TNOs)
